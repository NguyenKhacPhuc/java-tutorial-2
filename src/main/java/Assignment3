1. Class Access Modifier: public
- Reason: The Book class is made public so it can be accessed from any other class in the same package or different
packages. This is essential if you want to use this class as part of a library or in a different part of the application.
2. Attributes Access Modifier: private
- Reason: The attributes (title, author, price) are kept private to encapsulate the data and prevent direct access from
outside the class. This helps in maintaining control over the data, ensuring it can only be modified through defined
methods (setters).
3. Constructors Access Modifier: public
- Reason: Constructors are made public to allow objects of the Book class to be instantiated from outside the class. If
constructors were private, you wouldn't be able to create instances of Book in other classes.
4. Getters and Setters Access Modifier: public
- Reason: Getters and setters are made public to provide controlled access to the private attributes. They allow reading
and updating the attribute values while maintaining encapsulation. Setters can also include validation logic to ensure
the integrity of the data.
5. Methods (displayDetails and applyDiscount) Access Modifier: public
- Reason: The methods displayDetails and applyDiscount are made public to allow them to be invoked from outside the class.
This makes these functionalities available to other parts of the program, promoting reuse and interaction with the Book objects.
